This demo makes use of passportJwt and some light vanilla JS

Within Index.js you'll find the setup code for passport-jwt, express, routes, as well as a mock db (premade users). 

jwt_vanilla.js is a file that has 3 different ways of making ajax calls, 1. XMLHttpRequest, 2. es6 fetch, 3. async/await+fetch. Feel free to
uncomment/swap out functionality to see the code accomplish the same goal but in 3 different ways.

Run the app and see how JWTs are generated and used from the client to get back a secret from the server
