Download & run the app to see how JWTs are generated & used from the client to access user-authenticated data üîí üîë

**üöß‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß- this is a very basic demo with the sole purpose to generate JWTs and send them back to the server to retrieve a secret. This does not cover setting up a DB, password encryption, nor how to store the JWT in the client. Actually, for demo purposes I render the token to a paragraph element, this is by no means standard practice on how to handle a token on a client.**

## - App Stack -
##### Back End:
- node.js + passport-jwt module
##### Front End:
- HTML + light vanilla JS

Within Index.js you'll find the setup code for passport-jwt, express, routes, as well as a mock db (premade users). 

jwt_vanilla.js - equipped with 3 different options of making ajax calls for handling our token, 
  1. XMLHttpRequest, 
  2. es6 fetch, 
  3. async/await+fetch.
  
Feel free to uncomment/swap out functionality to see the code accomplish the same goal but in 3 different ways
